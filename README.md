# Conlang Notebook 

## Overview
Conlang Notebook is a tool that allows you to define a phonology to randomly generate words. After creating a phonology, you can improve Conlang Notebook's ability to generate words for language by giving feedback on which words you like or dislike. Your feedback is used to create a machine learning model that filters out words that are randomly generated.
